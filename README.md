## AdventOfCode2018

### Python ?
So, I'm having a go at the aoc 2018. I've decided to use Python since it's data types are more flexible. 

However, whilst I've done a bit of python code before, and am working through a machine learning book at the moment, that was a while ago and I'm not really up on the Python 3 libraries, syntax, etc etc since I am really a Swift devloper primarily at the moment.  Hopefully through the process of trying the tasks I can get a lot better at it.
